# LLama2_13B_RetrievalQA
RAG with LLaMa 2 13B-chat model in both Hugging Face transformers and LangChain

Overview
This repository hosts the llama_2_13b_retrievalqa.ipynb Jupyter notebook, demonstrating the use of the LLaMa2-13B model in a question-answering (QA) application, enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. The notebook is designed to showcase how the LLaMa2-13B model, a powerful language model, can be effectively combined with RAG for advanced QA tasks.

Features
LLaMa2-13B Model Integration: Utilizes the LLaMa2-13B model to answer complex questions.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Incorporates RAG techniques to enhance the model's ability to generate more accurate and relevant answers by retrieving contextual information from a database or corpus.

Interactive QA Examples: Interactive examples allow users to input questions and receive responses, demonstrating the model's QA capabilities in real-time.

Performance Analysis: Offers insights into the model's response quality and the effectiveness of RAG in various QA scenarios.
